  <description>Starpoint Shipyards, one of the biggest shipyards in this area of space, is home to the production factories where all the Touscha ships and outfits are made. The planet it orbits has been found to harbor plenty of raw materials, which are put to good use in the station above. Originally, it was only capable of building small outfits and ships, but it has expended over the years so that even capital ships are occasionally made here.</description>
  <bar>The bar is very featureless and bland, but the people here don't seem to notice or mind. Everyone here seems to be in a good mood, but they mostly keep to themselves for one reason or another. </bar>
